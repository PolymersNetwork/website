    },
    {
      question: "Is there a mobile app?",

    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
      answer: "We accept PLY, USDC, SOL, and CRT tokens through connected wallets, plus traditional payments via Apple Pay, Google Pay, and integrated payment processors for maximum convenience."
